         Hi, I'm Grace!  <img src="images/smiling.png" width= 25vw height="auto" alt="bird emoji">
        </h3>
        <img src="images/olive.png" width= 25vw height="auto" alt="bird emoji"> <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top:-25px;">
            I recently graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in 
            Mathematics with a minor in Data Science.  I'm interested in applying
            my math and data science skills to pressing, real world issues.  I have technical experience in machine learning, big data, and applied mathematics.
            <br>

            I grew up in Charlotte, NC until I moved to Durham, NC to attend The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM).  NCSSM is a public boarding school
            for high school juniors and seniors.  In high school, I was a physics teaching assistent and a research intern in NC State's Engineering Department.  Also, 
            I ran cross country/track and two half marathons.  I graduated high school in 2020 and then moved to Charlottesville, VA to attend UVA.  
            <br>

            At UVA, I was involved in WXTJ (the student radio) where I hosted a 2-hour radio show and served on the Exective Board as the Treasurer. Also, I 
            participated in the Math Department's Directed Reading Program (DRP), where I collaborated with Ph.D. student Eleanor McSpirit on a project titled, "The 
            Relationship between p(n) and S<sub>n</sub>".  My 20-minute presentation is included on the My Work tab.  I also was a teaching assistant in the 
            School of Data Science for a class called "Mathematics for Data Science".  This was a new course in the School of Data Science, so much of
            my work was creating learning materials in Jupyter Notebooks (where you can combine Python code and Markdown mathematical explanations).  This
            included creating the final project, a small Neural Network from scratch.  The starter code is included in the My Work tab (I can't provide
            the solution as this project is currently being used :) ).  
            <br>

            Outside the classroom, I participated in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Maryland Sea Grant and Univesity of 
            Maryland School of Environmental Sciences (UMCES).  I presented my project, titled "New Applications of Machine Learning in Marine Biogeochemistry", at the 
            2024 Ocean Sciences Meeting in New Orleans, LA.
