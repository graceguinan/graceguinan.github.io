            I recently graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in 
            Mathematics with a minor in Data Science.  I'm interested in applying
            my math and data science skills to important, real world issues.  My interests are wide-ranging, but include
            environmental science, public policy, and national security.  I have technical experience in machine learning, big data, and applied mathematics.

            <br>
            I grew up in Charlotte, NC until I moved to Durham, NC to attend The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM).  NCSSM is a public boarding school
            for high school juniors and seniors.  In high school, I was a physics teaching assistent and a research intern in NC State's Engineering Department.  Also, 
            I ran cross country/track and two half marathons.  I graduated high school in 2020 and then moved to Charlottesville, VA to attend UVA.

            At UVA, I was involved in WXTJ (the student radio) where I hosted a 2-hour radio show and served on the Exective Board as the Treasurer. Also, I 
            participated in the Math Department's Directed Reading Program (DRP), w
